  <h2>Your Custom Checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() == 'medium' && dwellingType() == 'skyrise'">Get under the 10th floor of your building.</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() != 'low' && dwellingType() == 'house'">Cover all of your home’s windows. Permanent storm shutters offer the best protection for windows. A second option is to board up windows with 5/8” marine plywood, cut to fit and ready to install. Tape does not prevent windows from breaking.</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() != 'high' && dwellingType() == 'house'">Clear loose and clogged rain gutters and downspouts.</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() != 'high' && dwellingType() == 'house'">Reinforce your garage doors; if wind enters a garage it can cause dangerous and expensive structural damage.</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() == 'low'">Back up all your personal documents digitally</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() == 'medium' && dwellingType() == 'house'">Plan to bring in all outdoor furniture, decorations, garbage cans and anything else that is not tied down.</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() != 'low'">Decide where your household/flatmates will reunite after a disaster. Identify two places to meet: one right outside your home and another outside your neighborhood, such as a library, community center, or place of worship.</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() == 'medium'">Leave natural gas on, unless local officials advise otherwise. If you turn gas off, a licensed professional is required to turn it back on, and it may take weeks for a professional to respond.</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() == 'high' && dwellingType() == 'house'">Turn off the main water valve.</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() == 'high' && dwellingType() == 'house'">Turn off electricity at the main fuse or breaker.</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() == 'high' && dwellingType() == 'house'">Turn off your propane tank.</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() != 'high'">Teach children how and when to call 911 or your local Emergency Medical Services number for emergency help.</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() != 'low'">Turn your refrigerator and freezer to the coldest setting. Keep them closed as much as possible so that food will last longer if the power goes out.</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() != 'low'">Register on the <a href="https://disastersafe.redcross.org">American Cross Safe and Well Website</a>.</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() == 'low'">Post emergency telephone numbers by phones (fire, police, ambulance, etc.)</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() == 'low'">Take a Red Cross first aid and CPR class.</li>
    <li data-bind="visible: urgency() == 'low'">Grab a beer.</li>
  </ul>
